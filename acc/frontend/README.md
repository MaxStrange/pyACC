# frontend

This is the directory for the frontend module. The frontend module is
responsible for collecting all of the metadata necessary for the backend
to do the actual work - the idea is that the backend will be handed a
well-defined internal representation (a bunch of code to modify and metadata
to utilize while doing so).

## TODO

- Define the API between the frontend and the backends.
- Finish the proof of concept
