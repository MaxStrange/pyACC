# BasicParsing

Unittests in this folder should be about testing the functionality of the front-end
parser for basic cases, i.e., cases that are non-specific in terms of directives, constructs,
or clauses. These test cases should make sure that no matter how convoluted the decorated
function is, the parser can still handle it.
